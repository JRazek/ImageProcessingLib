# ImageProcessingLib
Library for image processing. 
<br>
Currently convolutional neural networks with auto differentiation are supported.
<br>
For learning there are two optimizers to use - minibatch gradient descent and momentum gradient descent<br>
For any kind of image edition there are util functions in Utils class that may be used accordingly including image resampling, <br>
interpolations and matrix transformations.

Currently CUDA support is in progress as well as parallel convolutions on multiple devices for better performance.
