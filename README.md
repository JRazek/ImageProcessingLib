# ImageProcessingLib
Library for image processing. <br>
Currently convolutional neural networks with auto differentiation are supported.<br>
For learning there are two optimizers to use - minibatch gradient descent and momentum gradient descent<br>
For any kind of image resampling there are util functions in Utils class that may be used accordingly including image resampling, <br>
interpolations and matrix transformations.<br>

Currently CUDA support is in progress as well as paralelizm on multiple devices for better performance.
